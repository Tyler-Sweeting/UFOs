# UFOs

### Overviw of Project
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage using HTML, CSS and Javascript that takes a dataset of UFO sightings and puts them into a table that can be filtered by the user.
The first rendition we made could only be filtered by the date and was using a filter button, the final version can filter by any of date, cuty, state, country and shape at the same time.

### Results
The result of our project is a professional looking website that has an efficient search tool for the data in the table.

This is a photo of the search tool. I put placeholders in each one so that the user can see the format to input their filters.

To use the search tool, you simply type in a filter you wish to apply in any of the categories and then press enter. If you wish to clear the filters, you delete your filtered word and press enter again.

As you can see from the photo below, I filtered the table by state and shape to get a more percise table of the info I was looking for.

### Summary 
If I was to make one comment on a drawback of the new design, I would say that a search button might be more user friendly than pressing enter. 
If I was to work further on this project I would like to add a 'clear' button for the filtered search options. I would also like to add more data, possibly from other countries or even more recent sightings. One other option to make the table look more organized is to change the colour having the rows rotate colour.
